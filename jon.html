            <p>So I heard several times as a kid that I should eat more so I can like, get stronger or whatever but again, our parents had no idea about nutrition. So, you know, looking back, you know, our meals were mostly carbs and fat and very little protein, likely because that's what our parents ate when they were kids because of circumstance, because they grew up in post World War Two Chinese Cultural Revolution. Right. So I have thought before that if they had a little bit better sense of nutrition, then I wouldn't be as short or I'd probably be bigger.</p>
