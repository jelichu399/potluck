            <p>it's been a lot of going back to our parents and asking for recipe ideas (which i think people just do in general when they live on their own, but i guess what's different is how we have much more time to try this out). i fell into this routine of looking for recipes each day and watching a few videos. my mom has also been sending me a bunch of recipes via youtube bc my mandarian is so bad so she'll search it for me and send it to me</p>
